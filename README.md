# Welcome to Feed - A Simple Twitter Clone

Feed is our take on a basic Twitter clone, built with passion by <a href="https://github.com/TrevorStreng" target="_blank">Trevor Streng</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mannmanvir" target="_blank">Manvir Mann</a>. While it may not have all the bells and whistles of Twitter, it's a humble project where we're learning and experimenting with the essentials of microblogging. With Feed, we're creating a space for straightforward conversations, a place to share thoughts, and a platform to connect with others. As junior developers, this project is a stepping stone for us to grow our skills, and we're excited to share it with you. Join us on this learning journey with Feed! ðŸŒ±
